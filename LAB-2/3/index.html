            <p>The Covid-19 pandemic, caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, has been a global health crisis
                since its emergence in late 2019. It has affected millions of lives and led to significant changes in
                how we live and interact with one another.</p>

            <h2>Symptoms and Spread</h2>
            <p>Common symptoms of Covid-19 include fever, cough, and difficulty breathing. The virus primarily spreads
                through respiratory droplets when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or talks. It can also spread by
                touching surfaces contaminated with the virus.</p>

            <h2>Prevention Measures</h2>
            <p>To prevent the spread of Covid-19, it is crucial to follow preventive measures:</p>

                <li>Maintain physical distancing (at least 6 feet).</li>
                <li>Wash hands frequently with soap and water.</li>
                <li>Use hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol content.</li>
                <li>Avoid large gatherings and crowded places.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Vaccination Efforts</h2>
            <p>Various vaccines have been developed and distributed worldwide to combat Covid-19. Vaccination plays a
                crucial role in reducing the severity of the disease and preventing its spread. It is essential to
                follow local vaccination guidelines and get vaccinated when eligible.</p>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>Covid-19 continues to impact our lives, but by staying informed and following preventive measures, we
                can collectively work towards overcoming this pandemic and building a healthier future.</p>
